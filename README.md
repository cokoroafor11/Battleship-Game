Created a Battleship Game for a Master's Course Assignment  
The Battleship game is run through the Java File Battleship_Game.

Each type of ship has its own class designating the ship type and the length, which extends the ship class that is used to determine things such as where ships can be placed, whether a ship is sunk, and logging the location where the user wants to shoot the ship.
